							<p> 
								Welcome, my name is Osman Abdulrazak<br>
								A developer with experience working in Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, and mySQL.<br>
								Here I will demonstrate my work, various experiences, and the skillsets I've acquired along the way.
							</p>
						<h2 id = "aboutme">About Me</h2>
							<p id = "about-me">
								I am a first year computer science student at Queen Mary University Of London with a passion for software development and the creative nature that comes with it.
								In addition I co-captain a sports club, demonstrating key soft skills such as being able to work in a team; being able to communicate with others;
								and being able to lead.

								The reason why I've entered this field of work.
								What I enjoy the most about Computer Science is its ability to produce any imaginable technology. Coding in itself 
								is a medium of art form where a developer can be create whatever 
								want and have it do what they desire. It's become a tool that is used 
								everywhere and in every industry and how it's becoming so integrated 
								into everything in the modern world is something I find very interesting 
								and want to explore and be a part of. The exponential growth of technology 
								in our world excites me and I feel as though it's something I can be a 
								part of and help lead in my future career. 
							</p>

						<h2>Education</h2>
							<p>
								I am currently studying for my undergraduate's degree in BSc Computer Science at Queen Mary University Of London
